## General Information
- The objective here is to predict the share demand on the basis of diffrent indenpent veriable
- We have too may independent columns are provided in dataset, but few of them are highly corr. and few are unncesary. I just droped them.
- There are few categrorical columns so I added dummay veriable for categorirical
- For numerical veriables I used min-max scaling
- After droppping feature I finally achived a model with R-squared of 0.81 on training and 0.76 in test data
- VIF and p-value are low after final feature selection

## Conclusions
- **workingday, season_2, season_3, season_4, mnth_3, mnth_5, mnth_6, mnth_8, mnth_9, mnth_10, weekday_6, yr** have +ve contribution i.e. when these value increases then sharing count increases bu some amount
- **weathersit_2, weathersit_3, windspeed** have -ve contribution i.e. when these values increases then sharing count decresses
- **conts** - it is non-zero i.e. LR model is not pass throgh origin
- 74-75% of test value are covered with this model, hence its a good number which showing that we can use in real time data
